<h1>My Interest in Cinematography</h1>
<p>The angles, the lighting, the emotion, and the story. These all essential to creating a movie
   something that would be considered art. The way of cinematography is complex, but also simple.
   Finding the right angle for the shots, finding actors that fit the role, finding the correct scenery,
   adjusting the lighting to add realism to scenes, making a story fit for the theme or moral, even the
   musical numbers that emphasize certain scenes, and finally seeing how the movie would be recieved.  </p>

   <ul>Lighting,
       angles,
       scenery,
       actors,
       music, and
       theme.
   </ul>

<p>Now what would be an example of a movie that encapsulates that all perfectly, then I would have to
    say that movie is Drive(2011), possibly one of the best movies in my personal opinion. The movies
    lighting is an especially amazing aspect, the choice of music isn't random, but chosen to represent 
    moods of the driver. By the way, the main character doesn't have a name, he always just referred to
    as the driver. The movies word count also is below 1000 words, keeping it more action than words.
    But, when they do speak it's impactful the way they do speak is slow and introverted, yet they seem
    to understand eachother. LIke their having a conversation we can't here. The choice of actor for the
    driver is also notable, being hit actor Ryan Gosling, who would later be known for his role in 
    Bladerunner 2049. This all brings it in as a movie that hits all of the monomers for a good movie.
</p>

<ol>Ryan Gosling, Drive(2011), Impact</ol>

<p>To wrap it all out the movies I love share these, but the ones that change you are the ones
    that make you change how you act. How you even exist and act around the world, the very essence
    of a movie can change you; to your very soul. In short the filimg of a movie is one of beauty
    and one that should be treasured. It's always the best.
